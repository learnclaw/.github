# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security reports.

Preferred options:

1. Use **GitHub Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting** (if enabled in the affected repository).
2. If that’s not available, contact the maintainers privately (add a contact method here, e.g. `security@learnclaw.ai`).

## Scope

This policy covers repositories under the LearnClaw GitHub organization.
