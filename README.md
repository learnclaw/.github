# learnclaw/.github

This repository hosts **default community health files** and the **organization profile** for the LearnClaw GitHub organization.

- Org profile: `profile/README.md` → shown on `https://github.com/learnclaw`
- Defaults for new/public repos (when a repo doesn’t override them): issue templates, PR template, contributing, security, support, code of conduct

If you’re editing this repo locally, you’ll typically want to update:

- `profile/README.md` (positioning + links)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` (issue forms + contact links)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (contribution workflow)
