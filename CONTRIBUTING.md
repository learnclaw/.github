# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to LearnClaw projects!

## Where to start

- Read the repo’s `README.md` first (setup, goals, and scope).
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- If you’re unsure, start a Discussion (if enabled) or open a lightweight issue.

## Issues

When opening an issue, please include:

- What you expected vs what happened
- Repro steps (ideally minimal)
- Environment details (OS, runtime, versions)
- Screenshots / logs when relevant

## Pull requests

We love small, focused PRs.

- One PR = one change
- Add or update docs/comments when behavior changes
- Include tests when feasible
- Keep public-facing content accurate (avoid claiming features not shipped)

## Security

If you believe you found a security issue, **do not** open a public issue. Please follow `SECURITY.md`.
